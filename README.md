## Summary
Jenny’s Kitchen is a 100% gluten-free artisan bakery, located in Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, Ireland. The purpose of this website is to showcase the bakery’s range of goods, appealing to coeliacs and non-coeliacs alike; present potential customers with information about the bakery; and enable customers to place orders in advance to not only avoid disappointment, but to enquire about allergen-friendly options. 

## Aim of the site
Coeliac Disease - a disease that makes a person hypersensitive to gluten and can lead to difficulty in digesting food - affects 1% of the population, which makes Ireland one of the most prevalent countries for this disease. The Coeliac Society of Ireland estimates that for each person diagnosed, there are possibly between five and ten undiagnosed. Meanwhile, 13% of the population may be intolerant to gluten, which results in similar unpleasant symptoms but doesn’t appear to affect the lining of the gut.  


While there are a significant number of coeliacs and gluten intolerant people in Ireland, we have seen gluten-free options that either don’t taste very good or are often put on a menu as an afterthought. Many are unable to cater for coeliacs as the risk of cross contamination is too high. That is where Jenny’s Kitchen as a 100% gluten-free bakery differs. We believe that everyone should be able to enjoy bread, pastries, and desserts; the simple pleasures in life!


It is important that not only do coeliacs have options, but that they taste great; so good, in fact, that their friends or family who are not impacted by gluten would be more than happy to join them for a baked good.


The purpose of this website is to showcase the variety of baked goods on offer and that they look like “the real thing” that non-coeliacs get to enjoy. This website will provide users with information about the options available, including other allergen information, information about the business, and present users with a means of ordering in advance, customising the order somewhat if necessary.


## UX 
Jenny’s Kitchen opened in 2016 and hopes to grow its business further, broadening awareness among potential customers based in the region and beyond. It is important to do this visually to entice people to visit the bakery and try the food for themselves. Gluten-free food does not have a great reputation, so appealing imagery is important to showcase to coeliacs and non-coeliacs alike just how good it can be.

There are two different customer groups being targeted with this website, although they have similar end goals, while we as a business have our own distinct goals.

### User Stories
“As a coeliac, I want to see the range of products on offer so that I can see if Jenny’s Kitchen is different to other bakeries”


“As someone with another allergy on top of coeliac disease, I want to find out what allergens Jenny’s Kitchen’s baked goods contain so that I can make choices to fit my needs”


“As a local who doesn’t have an intolerance to gluten, I wish to be able to see what the baked goods look like so that I can see if something looks appealing”


“As someone interested in dropping in, I wish to find out when the bakery is open and where it is so that I can visit it for myself”


“As a friend to someone who is coeliac, I want to be able to place an order for a special occasion to surprise them with a tasty birthday cake”

### Business Goals
“We want to be able to emphasise our Unique Selling Point (USP) which is that we are a 100% gluten-free bakery and can accommodate other allergies too”


“We wish to be able to highlight the talents of our bakers and showcase the range of products on offer”


“As a business, we want customers to be able to place orders in advance so that we can resource our ingredients and staff appropriately to avoid disappointment”


### Design Choices
#### Colours
The basic colour scheme of yellow, brown, and a darker brown was chosen because it feels warm and inviting, provided a good platform for the visual elements of the website to stand out, and provided a good contrast for legibility and accessibility. These colours are frequently found in baking too as the crusty brown exterior of a loaf of bread gives way to an offwhite or yellow-tinged interior.

#### Fonts
Three fonts appear on the website: Pinyon Script, Open Sans, and Oswald.


Pinyon Script is used for the brand name as it looks quite refined, yet also feels friendly. However, it was not practical to use at smaller font sizes as it didn’t feel right, which is why Open Sans was used for page headings. Open Sans is not only legible, but also exhibits a friendly appearance by design. Oswald compliments this font nicely and was determined to be a great choice for use in lengthier paragraphs and writeups.


## Wireframe Mockups
Wireframes that guided the design of this website can be found here:

## Features
### Image Carousel 
One of the first elements that greets users to the website is an image carousel, which presents a visual preview of the care and craft of our staff as well as an indication of the type of item that one would be able to order.
### Visual Menu 
It was important to the business owner to be able to present information visually. This acts as a treat for the eyes and hopefully gets coeliacs and non-coeliacs excited about coming in.
### Downloadable Allergens Menu 
While gluten is one allergen that is catered for extensively, it can be difficult for people with other allergies to find suitable options. This downloadable menu enables customers to browse in advance, rather than potentially feeling under pressure at the counter, and find suitable options. It also informs them of options that could be made to order.
### Order Form 
Whether it’s just a case of a customer wanting something in particular when they visit, they wish to order something for a special occasion, or a customer wishes to have a treat made up to cater for their allergies, we offer an order form to ensure that we can cater for customers and their needs. 

## Features Left to Implement
### Credit Card Payment
While users can currently place an order, there is no facility for them to pay in advance. This could lead to orders not being collected. As a result, the business owner is keen to implement a payment facility.

### Google Maps
To improve upon the existing static image that links to the Google Maps pin for Jenny’s Kitchen, we would like to integrate a Google Maps frame that would allow users to find out more information and find the location in relation to themselves or another landmark.

### Collection Calendar
To build upon the form that asks for a collection date, we would like to implement a more fully fledged datepicker. We have found a [bootstrap datepicker](https://uxsolutions.github.io/bootstrap-datepicker/?markup=input&format=&weekStart=&startDate=&endDate=&startView=0&minViewMode=0&maxViewMode=4&todayBtn=false&clearBtn=false&language=en&orientation=auto&multidate=&multidateSeparator=&keyboardNavigation=on&forceParse=on#sandbox) in alpha that we may explore further.

### Tooltips
There is scope to add tooltips to accompany the images of allergens on menu items, which would clarify what the symbols represent when someone hovers over the icons.

## Testing

* Chrome Developer Tools - Frequent testing was carried out using Chrome’s developer tools to ensure that the content of the site behaved properly and looked good across a range of screen sizes. This was also utilised to ensure that there was sufficient contrast between text and the background colour.

* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) - The project was checked throughout development using the HTML Validator and issues were corrected along the way. 

* [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) - Before finalising the project, the CSS file was run through a CSS Validator to ensure that no errors occurred. 

* [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) - This tool was used to check the responsiveness of the website as it is much faster to analyse different screen sizes than the Chrome Developer Tools. This showcases how the website looks across a number of devices and orientations including iPhone "eXpensive", Android (Pixel 2), iPhone 6-8, iPhone 6-8 Plump, and iPad.  

* [Unicorn Revealer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln) - This Chrome Extension, from a Code Institute alumni, showcases borders and overflows, making it easier to debug. This extension was utilised from time to time, particularly when elements weren’t lining up correctly, which did occur on the Menu page when the Google Maps image was added initially.

* [Contrast Ratio](http://contrast-ratio.com/) - Like Chrome’s developer tools, this website allowed me to check colours of text and backgrounds to ensure that they would be readable. It provides a precise contrast and ensures that the colour combination used will pass AAA level for any size text. The inverse of the below combinations produces the same result.

### Results:

| Background | Text Colour | Result | Example of Use | Additional Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rgb(255, 255, 231) |  rgb(61, 34, 6) | 14.48 |  | Passes AAA level for any size text
| rgb(111, 78, 51) |  rgb(255, 255, 231) | 7.36 | | Passes AAA level for any size text
| rgb(255, 255, 231) | rgb(61, 34, 6, .8) | 7.71 | Other nav menu options that are not the active page | Passes AAA level for any size text
| rgb(255, 255, 231) | rgb(61, 34, 6, .8) | 7.71 | Non-active nav menu options | Passes AAA level for any size text
| rgb(255, 255, 231) | rgb(61, 34, 6, .9) | 10.73 | Non-active nav menu options on hover | Passes AAA level for any size text

* [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) - This website was utilised to access the accessibility of this website. Each page of the website was input separately into the WAVE website. This produces a list of Errors, Contrast Errors, Alerts, Features, Structural Elements, and ARIA. The results of this tool can be read below.

### Index.html
Two contrast errors were highlighted in relation to the carousel and overlay text. The tool detected a very low contrast between the text and the background colour as the body of the page is the same colour as the font. The tool ignores the presence of the background image contained in the carousel as it states that adequate contrast must be provided when images are disabled or unavailable. In this instance, it also ignores the presence of the semi-transparent div element as it states, “Contrast is not tested when background gradients, transparency, etc. are present.” As a result, we feel that the page is suitable as is.


Alerts were produced by the practice of skipping heading levels, as the section headings (h4) and proceeded by the footer headings (h6). This was done to utilise heading sizes that seemed most fitting for these sections and did not appear to have a negative effect on the website or user experience. These alerts are replicated on the proceeding pages too.


In order to highlight the current page that the user is on, we have underlined the current page’s title in the navigation menu. We have combined this with an increased size and slightly different colour to indicate using more than just colour (as recommended in [Google’s Accessible Styles guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/accessible-styles#color_and_contrast). However, the underlined text is highlighted by the WAVE tool as an alert, but in this case it is both linked text and presents information in a clearer manner to the end user. This alert is replicated on each proceeding page. 

### Menu.html
One error was highlighted pointing to an empty link, i.e. a link that contains no text. This was in relation to the navigation arrow fixed to the right hand side of the page. It was highlighted that the lack of text could introduce confusion for keyboard and screen reader users. As a result, I added a span with the class of sr-only to explain that the link would bring the user back to the top of the page.


This report also highlighted that the alt descriptions of the allergen images were the same as the text beside them. This can cause issues for screen readers, as it essentially results in doubling up of the term being read. WHAT TO DO?


### About.html
One contrast error was produced by the inclusion of a header on an overlay of an image. As with the index page, we are happy that the page performs as best it can.


A redundant link was highlighted by the presence of the map images that point to the same link. However, these images are not displayed at the same time regardless of whether or not the user is using a screen reader, so it has no bearing on the user experience. 


### Order.html
As the text sits atop an overlay with a background image displayed underneath, there are a number of contrast errors highlighted. As with previous pages, these tests do not account for the semi-transparent div element that provides some additional contrast.

## Meeting User Expectations
As outlined in the user stories, there are a variety of reasons why someone may visit the website. In addition, we as a business had goals of our own when undertaking this project. Here is how the website meets these goals and expectations.

### As a user
* “As a coeliac, I want to see the range of products on offer so that I can see if Jenny’s Kitchen is different to other bakeries”

We provide a comprehensive and visual menu that provides customers with an idea of what to expect. While researching competitor websites, we noticed that many relied on text alone - a bagel is a bagel after all - but we wanted to be able to showcase that gluten free food can look (and subsequently taste) just as good as food that contains wheat and gluten.

* “As someone with another allergy on top of coeliac disease, I want to find out what allergens Jenny’s Kitchen’s baked goods contain so that I can make choices to fit my needs”

We provide allergen information next to each menu item, while an allergen menu can be downloaded for browsing at leisure. In addition, we provide the option to order in advance, which allows for greater customisation and allergy friendliness.

* “As a local who doesn’t have an intolerance to gluten, I wish to be able to see what the baked goods look like so that I can see if something looks appealing”

As highlighted above, we provide a visual menu to show off the quality of our baked goods and the talents of our bakers.

* “As someone interested in dropping in, I wish to find out when the bakery is open and where it is so that I can visit it for myself”

The opening hours are displayed in the footer of each webpage along with the address. The About Us page also contains a linked Google Maps image so that people can get directions from their location.

* “As a friend to someone who is coeliac, I want to be able to place an order for a special occasion to surprise them with a tasty birthday cake”

We enable users to order something from us and if further information is required from the customer, we ask for their contact details. This allows us to follow up in any clarification is needed.

### As a business
* “We want to be able to emphasise our Unique Selling Point (USP) which is that we are a 100% gluten-free bakery and can accommodate other allergies too”

One of the first things that people see when visiting the website is a large carousel that outlines prominently that Jenny’s Kitchen is a 100% gluten-free bakery. This point is drilled into further in the About Us section, which details how we differ from other bakeries and that our gluten-free food tastes amazing to both coeliacs and non-coeliacs alike. 

* “We wish to be able to highlight the talents of our bakers and showcase the range of products on offer”

Our visual menu and pictures throughout the website show off the range of baked goods available and just how talented our bakers are.

* “As a business, we want customers to be able to place orders in advance so that we can resource our ingredients and staff appropriately to avoid disappointment”

While a certain amount of baked goods have to be produced on a daily basis, our order form - that allows customers to specify a collection date - enables us to have some lead time and forewarning regarding orders and potentially busy periods. This means that we can order additional raw materials and schedule our roster accordingly. 



## Issues and Resolutions
Over the course of this project, some issues were encountered, which I will detail here. Any outstanding issues are outlined in the “Any Known Issues?” section located below. 

### Carousel Whitespace
When I initially setup the carousel with my images and tested it in action, a white background appeared to the sides when the image cycled to the next. This was rectified using advice found in the comments on a GitHub issue. [Anantajitjg outlined](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/24657#issuecomment-360552841) that adding a visible backface-visibility and an ease transition solved this issue.

### Index.html Columns Differing In Height
The three columns on index.html - Allergens, About, and Order Online - did not line up in height initially with just a header, the image, the text content, and a button to bring the user to the relevant page. While I could have used a Bootstrap card element for the content box itself, this also left me with mismatching heights unless the content was of similar length. This would not be practical in a live environment, particularly if changes are required later. 


The align-items-stretch class ensured that the columns matched the height of the tallest column. It was then necessary to absolute position the buttons of these columns to ensure that they lined up correctly. This required the additional use of a spacer div, as [suggested by Maarti on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12408519), which ensured that the buttons did not overlap the text, particularly on mobile devices.


### Any known issues?
#### Order Form - Invalid Collection Date
It is possible to submit the form with a date selected that has already passed.

#### Order Form - Submission of Order Form
On successful submission of the order form, a message appears to thank a user for their order, and the page refreshes when this dialog box is accepted. If a user places a second order on this page, the dialog box appears as it should, but when accepted the page does not refresh and the order form still has the fields filled.

## Credits 
### Content
[Change image on hover](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-change-image-on-hover-with-css.php) - Using the Tutorial Republic guide, I was able to correctly position and enable a change of image when a user hovered over the brand’s logo. A logo with inverted colours was used, which stands out against the yellow background, while a drop shadow is also applied on hover. This signified that the logo is a link that can be clicked on, behaviour that is mirrored elsewhere on the site.


[Hover.css](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover) - In order to highlight links that could be interacted with, the Hover.css library of effects was used. The grow effect is applied to menu items and buttons, while grow rotate is applied to social media links as they are smaller and the additional rotate makes their interactivity more noticable. 


[Smooth scroll](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/scroll-behavior/) - After experimenting with a smooth scroll using JavaScript, I later found a solution on CSS-Tricks using CSS, which worked perfectly.
