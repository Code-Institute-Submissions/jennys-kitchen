## Summary
Jenny’s Kitchen is a 100% gluten-free artisan bakery, located in Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, Ireland. The purpose of this website is to showcase the bakery’s range of goods, appealing to coeliacs and non-coeliacs alike; present potential customers with information about the bakery; and enable customers to place orders in advance to not only avoid disappointment, but to enquire about allergen-friendly options. 

## Aim of the site
Coeliac Disease - a disease that makes a person hypersensitive to gluten and can lead to difficulty in digesting food - affects 1% of the population, which makes Ireland one of the most prevalent countries for this disease. The Coeliac Society of Ireland estimates that for each person diagnosed, there are possibly between five and ten undiagnosed. Meanwhile, 13% of the population may be intolerant to gluten, which results in similar unpleasant symptoms but doesn’t appear to affect the lining of the gut.  


While there are a significant number of coeliacs and gluten intolerant people in Ireland, we have seen gluten-free options that either don’t taste very good or are often put on a menu as an afterthought. Many are unable to cater for coeliacs as the risk of cross contamination is too high. That is where Jenny’s Kitchen as a 100% gluten-free bakery differs. We believe that everyone should be able to enjoy bread, pastries, and desserts; the simple pleasures in life!


It is important that not only do coeliacs have options, but that they taste great; so good, in fact, that their friends or family who are not impacted by gluten would be more than happy to join them for a baked good.


The purpose of this website is to showcase the variety of baked goods on offer and that they look like “the real thing” that non-coeliacs get to enjoy. This website will provide users with information about the options available, including other allergen information, information about the business, and present users with a means of ordering in advance, customising the order somewhat if necessary.


## UX 
Jenny’s Kitchen opened in 2016 and hopes to grow its business further, broadening awareness among potential customers based in the region and beyond. It is important to do this visually to entice people to visit the bakery and try the food for themselves. Gluten-free food does not have a great reputation, so appealing imagery is important to showcase to coeliacs and non-coeliacs alike just how good it can be.

There are two different customer groups being targeted with this website, although they have similar end goals, while we as a business have our own distinct goals.

### User Stories
“As a coeliac, I want to see the range of products on offer so that I can see if Jenny’s Kitchen is different to other bakeries”


“As someone with another allergy on top of coeliac disease, I want to find out what allergens Jenny’s Kitchen’s baked goods contain so that I can make choices to fit my needs”


“As a local who doesn’t have an intolerance to gluten, I wish to be able to see what the baked goods look like so that I can see if something looks appealing”


“As someone interested in dropping in, I wish to find out when the bakery is open and where it is so that I can visit it for myself”


“As a friend to someone who is coeliac, I want to be able to place an order for a special occasion to surprise them with a tasty birthday cake”

### Business Goals
“We want to be able to emphasise our Unique Selling Point (USP) which is that we are a 100% gluten-free bakery and can accommodate other allergies too”


“We wish to be able to highlight the talents of our bakers and showcase the range of products on offer”


“As a business, we want customers to be able to place orders in advance so that we can resource our ingredients and staff appropriately to avoid disappointment”


### Design Choices
#### Colors
The basic color scheme of yellow, brown, and a darker brown was chosen because it feels warm and inviting, provided a good platform for the visual elements of the website to stand out, and provided a good contrast for legibility and accessibility. These colors are frequently found in baking too as the crusty brown exterior of a loaf of bread gives way to an offwhite or yellow-tinged interior.

#### Fonts
Three fonts appear on the website: Pinyon Script, Open Sans, and Oswald.


Pinyon Script is used for the brand name as it looks quite refined, yet also feels friendly. However, it was not practical to use at smaller font sizes as it didn’t feel right, which is why Open Sans was used for page headings. Open Sans is not only legible, but also exhibits a friendly appearance by design. Oswald compliments this font nicely and was determined to be a great choice for use in lengthier paragraphs and writeups.


## Wireframe Mockups

## Features
TBA


## Features Left to Implement
### Credit Card Payment
While users can currently place an order, there is no facility for them to pay in advance. This could lead to orders not being collected. As a result, the business owner is keen to implement a payment facility.

### Google Maps
To improve upon the existing static image that links to the Google Maps pin for Jenny’s Kitchen, we would like to integrate a Google Maps frame that would allow users to find out more information and find the location in relation to themselves or another landmark.

### Collection Calendar
To build upon the form that asks for a collection date, we would like to implement a more fully fledged datepicker. We have found a [bootstrap datepicker](https://uxsolutions.github.io/bootstrap-datepicker/?markup=input&format=&weekStart=&startDate=&endDate=&startView=0&minViewMode=0&maxViewMode=4&todayBtn=false&clearBtn=false&language=en&orientation=auto&multidate=&multidateSeparator=&keyboardNavigation=on&forceParse=on#sandbox) in alpha that we may explore further.

This website was also tested on a range of devices and internet browsers:



### Testing Process




## Issues and Resolutions
Over the course of this project, some issues were encountered, which I will detail here. Any outstanding issues are outlined in the “Any Known Issues?” section located below. 

### Carousel Whitespace
When I initially setup the carousel with my images and tested it in action, a white background appeared to the sides when the image cycled to the next. This was rectified using advice found in the comments on a GitHub issue. [Anantajitjg outlined](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/24657#issuecomment-360552841) that adding a visible backface-visibility and a ease transition solved this issue.

### Index.html Columns Differing In Height
The three columns on index.html - Allergens, About, and Order Online - did not line up in height initially with just a header, the image, the text content, and a button to bring the user to the relevant page. While I could have used a Bootstrap card element for the content box itself, this also left me with mismatching heights unless the content was of similar length. This would not be practical in a live environment, particularly if changes are required later. 


The align-items-stretch class ensured that the columns matched the height of the tallest column. It was then necessary to absolute position the buttons of these columns to ensure that they lined up correctly. This required the additional use of a spacer div, as [suggested by Maarti on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12408519), which ensured that the buttons did not overlap the text, particularly on mobile devices.
